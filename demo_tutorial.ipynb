Those days, the apple tree had given the choicest of apples to him. 4 However, as time passed, the apple tree became old and stopped bearing fruits. 5 Now that the farmer was not getting any apples from the tree, he decided that the tree was useless. 6 Therefore, he decided to cut the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture. 7 He felt that since the tree was old and huge, he did not have to cure it, and it would make great furniture. 8 He forgot that as a boy, he had spent his entire childhood climbing the tree and eating its apples. 9 Now the apple tree was home to several little animals in the neighborhood. 10 This included squirrels, sparrows and a huge variety of birds and insects. 11 When the farmer took his axe and began chopping the tree, all the little animals came rushing down. 12 They all began to plead with the farmer. 13 They gathered round the farmer and said, “Please don’t cut the tree. We used to play with you when you were small, under this very tree. 14 This is our home and we have no other place to go”. 15 The farmer was adamant. He raised his axe and the commotion grew. 16 “Please don’t chop and destroy my home and kids,” cried the squirrel. 17 “Please don’t chop and destroy my nest,” cried the little birds. 18 “Please don’t cut the apple tree,” cried the grasshopper. 19 The farmer, however, forgot his childhood and his animal friends. 20 He began to chop the tree harder.  \n"," 21 All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to _ the apple tree at any cost. \n"," ['begin', 'cry', 'cut', 'destroy', 'climb', 'protect', 'cure', 'chop', 'forget', 'take'] \n","\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["100%|██████████| 1248501532/1248501532 [00:36<00:00, 34109772.07B/s]\n","100%|██████████| 231508/231508 [00:00<00:00, 444466.74B/s]\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["predicted_token:\n"," get\n","After predicting: \n"," 21 All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to _get_ the apple tree at any cost.\n","[================================------------------] 64.8% 1077.4/1662.8MB downloadedBuffered data was truncated after reaching the output size limit."],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
